the esp bot is a simple example/bare outline for using a esp board with a arduino(or without) as a type of restful api that uses URL encoding to initiate code. the discord bot just sends the URL encoded commands from chat. this same system can be used with other chat bots unrelated to discord, this is just a implimentation of it with discord.

the Karma bot is just a part of my larger Karma project, a lot of its features are tied to the database it works with and the express rest API it is using. see the karma project repo or my rest API repo for a better explonation.
